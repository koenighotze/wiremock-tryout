# Wiremock Examples

This repository explores the features of http://wiremock.org[Wiremock].

It uses http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring-Boot] for exposing and consuming a simple REST service.

## The server

A simple REST endpoint is implemented in `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.service.SampleController`.
It exposes `Sample`s at `http://localhost:8080/sample/`. Otherwise nothing special is happening of note.
The server is started by running `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.service.SampleApplication`.

## The client

Also a simple REST client (org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.client.SampleControllerClient) is implemented.
The client can be run by starting `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.client.SampleControllerClientApplication`.
It tries to consume http://localhost:8080/sample/ via GET.

The client is the actual target for the tests using Wiremock.

A typical Spring MockMvc test is implemented in `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.service.SampleControllerSpec`.

## Wiremock

Wiremock can be used in standalone mode and via unit tests.

### Scenarios

#### Stubbing

See `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.client.SampleControllerClientStubbingSpec`.

#### Faults

See `org.koenighotze.wiremocktryout.client.SampleControllerClientFailSpec`.

* Request Timeouts
* Socket Timeout
* Bad response

#### Record and Playback

This is based on running Wiremock as a proxy. This section explains the steps to set it up for recording requests to the
sample server and serve them back afterwards.

* Start sample server
```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

* Start Wiremock in proxy mode
```bash
$ curl -O http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock/1.57/wiremock-1.57-standalone.jar
$ java -jar wiremock-1.57-standalone.jar \
        --proxy-all="http://localhost:8080" \
        --port=8081 \
        --record-mappings \
        --root-dir=wiremock-root \
        --match-headers="Accept,Content-Type" \
        --verbose
```

* Record request
```bash
$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8081/sample
$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8081/sample/1
```

The directory `wiremock-root/mappings/` contains the request mappings, i.e. which request maps to which reply.
The directory `wiremock-root/__files/` contains the actual response data.

* Stop sample server
* Start Wiremock in playback mode

```bash
$ java -jar wiremock-1.57-standalone.jar
        --proxy-all="http://localhost:8080" \
        --port=8080 \
        --root-dir=wiremock-root \
        --match-headers="Accept,Content-Type" \
         --verbose
```

* Start client and watch recorded request being served
